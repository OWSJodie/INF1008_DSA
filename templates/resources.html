            <h2>Common Ransomware Attacks</h2>
            RansomX provides information about various ransomware attacks. Some of the commonly known ransomware
            attacks include WannaCry, Petya, Locky, CryptoLocker, Ryuk, and SamSam.
            </p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Details of Common Ransomware Attacks</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>WannaCry:</strong>
                WannaCry is a highly notorious ransomware that emerged in May 2017. It leveraged a vulnerability in
                Windows operating systems known as EternalBlue to rapidly spread across networks. The attack affected
                hundreds of thousands of computers in more than 150 countries, including organizations like hospitals,
                businesses, and government agencies. WannaCry encrypted victims' files and demanded ransom payments in
                Bitcoin to provide decryption keys. It caused massive disruption and financial losses, highlighting the
                importance of keeping software up to date and implementing robust cybersecurity measures.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Petya (NotPetya):</strong>
                Petya, also known as NotPetya, appeared in June 2017 and caused widespread damage. Like WannaCry, Petya
                exploited the EternalBlue vulnerability to propagate rapidly. However, it was not a traditional
                ransomware in the sense that its encryption mechanism was flawed, making file recovery nearly
                impossible. Instead of being driven by financial motives, Petya's primary goal appeared to be
                disruption, particularly targeting organizations in Ukraine and various sectors globally. Petya raised
                concerns about the potential involvement of nation-state actors in cyberattacks.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Locky:</strong>
                Locky is a well-known ransomware that first emerged in early 2016. It predominantly spread via email
                attachments, especially in malicious Microsoft Word documents. Upon execution, Locky encrypted files on
                the victim's computer and demanded a ransom for decryption. Locky's distribution was widespread,
                impacting numerous individuals and businesses worldwide.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>CryptoLocker:</strong>
                CryptoLocker was one of the earliest and most significant ransomware variants, observed around September
                2013. It commonly propagated through malicious email attachments, encrypting victims' files with strong
                encryption. The ransom demanded by CryptoLocker was typically paid in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.
                CryptoLocker significantly impacted users, leading to increased awareness of ransomware threats.
